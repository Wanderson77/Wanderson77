I build applications with JavaScript. Lately, I'm making many useful things with React and Next.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to open source, that's the reason I help to maintain projects like Unform and Gatsby Themes.

Currently, I am working at Rocketseat. If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me an email or follow me on Twitter. Looking forward to connecting with you.
